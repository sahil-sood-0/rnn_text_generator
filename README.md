# rnn_text_generator
I have trained a neural network to write texts similar to those of the famous poet Shakespeare. At least kind of. Since recurrent neural networks and LSTMs in particular have a short term memory, I have trained it to “guess” the next letter based on the letters that came before. That leads to our network producing these texts.
